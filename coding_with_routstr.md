# Roo Code and Goose Shine When Coding with Freedom AI Tech

If using Cursor or Claude Code while billing to your credit card is the gold standard for AI coding—if you don't mind using your real identity and being spied upon—then Roo Code and Goose, plugging into Routstr, are the gold standard if you are Satoshi and want to stay private.

In this post, I'll guide you through the simple process of setting up your coding environment with VSCode (using Roo Code), a terminal (with Goose), and Bitcoin, all with the help of Routstr.

## Coding in VSCode with Roo Code

Before you open VSCode, create a Cashu token worth 1.5k to 5k sats (recommended for top models) and have it ready. (If you don't know how, check out the section at the end of this article.) Here's how you can get started:
1.  Install [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) from the VSCode Extensions Marketplace.
2.  Choose OpenRouter as your API Provider (Routstr uses the same model names).
3.  For now, in the API Key field, just enter some random characters.

4.  Once you're inside, click on the **default** mode and click **Edit**.
5.  Enable **custom base URL** and enter `https://api.routstr.com` there.
6.  Now, in the **API Key** field, enter the Cashu token you created.

**That's it! You can start coding!**

## Using Goose with Routstr

I hope you have a Cashu token (check out the next section if not). Proceed as follows:
1.  Download Goose for your device from [here](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation).
2.  It's easier on Goose. Choose **OpenAI Compatible** as the provider.
3.  Enter `https://api.routstr.com` as the base URL.
4.  Enter your Cashu token as the API key.
5.  Choose a model, as it automatically fetches from the API.

**That's it! You can now create Freedom Agents!**

## No Emails, No Sign-ups, Just Cashu & Lightning

You can use any of the top LLMs via Routstr by inputting `https://api.routstr.com/` and an API Key into Roo Code or Goose. This is similar to using it via OpenRouter, but without the need to sign up using email or top up using fiat or the Coinbase chain. Here are the steps in more detail:
(Skip to step 4 if you already have a Cashu wallet)
1.  Set up a Cashu wallet (cashu.me or others).
2.  Deposit some sats using Bitcoin Lightning (at least 5k sats for top models).
3.  Create a Cashu token (at least 5k sats, but 10 sats is also fine if you want to use 8b models).
4.  Voila! That's it. Your Cashu token is your API key.
Lastly, here's how you can top up your Cashu token and also manage your API Keys in a more organized manner.

## Top-up and Key Management

I've been using Roo Code and Goose via Routstr for a while now. The best way to keep track of all your Cashu tokens and API keys has been through the chat app we have [here](https://chat.routstr.com). Here's how:
1.  Log in to the chat app (chat.routstr.com) using your Nostr extension or create a new nsec just for this.
2.  Deposit some sats using Lightning or Cashu into the NIP60 wallet we have. (If you already have a NIP60 wallet attached to your Nostr pubkey, it should show up.)
3.  Go to the API keys section and create API keys that are encrypted and synced to Nostr relays using NIP44.
4.  Be sure to back up your `nsec` if you just created it, as your wallet balance and API keys are attached to that private key.

If you don't want to use the chat app and just want a way to top up your current Cashu token to avoid creating one every now and then, you can use our top-up interface [here](https://routstr.com/topup).
